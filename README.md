# Hamming Net Implementation

This repository contains the final assignment for the Neuroscience class at Ariel University.

## Description

This project implements a Hamming network using Jupyter Notebook. The Hamming network is a type of artificial neural network used for pattern recognition.

## Usage

### Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and learn patterns. Neural networks are widely used in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

### Hamming Network

The Hamming network is a type of neural network designed for pattern recognition and error correction. It works by comparing input patterns to stored patterns and determining the degree of similarity. The network is particularly effective in identifying and correcting errors in binary data.
